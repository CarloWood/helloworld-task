# filelock-task submodule

This repository is a cwm4 [git submodule](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules)
providing a [statefultask](https://github.com/CarloWood/ai-statefultask)
that performs a file lock, and a thread lock for that file lock; so that it can be used,
for example, to cooperatively negotiate exclusive access to (a part of a) harddisk.

## Usage of the submodule.

Please read [this document](https://github.com/CarloWood/cwm4/blob/master/README_usage.md) for general information
on how to use cwm4 submodules.
